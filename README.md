# Interest Rate Project
 Conducted an analysis to determine the accuracy of interest rate predictions by economic researchers in Colombiaâ€™s central bank surveys from July 2014 to May 2023 (https://www.banrep.gov.co/es/estadisticas/encuesta-mensual-expectativas-analistas-economicos).
 
Worked independently, using Microsoft Excel and Python to extract, clean and transform data, and PowerBI to visualize and analyse the results of the survey (see InterestRate_Projection_Report.pbix file).

Using this Dashboard, I found that we can rely on interest rate projections from analalyst up to the following 3 months, but projections further away in time and should adjust be adjusted above or below the respondent's standard deviation, depending on the direction of actual interest rates. These insights wee used to update my company's cash flow forecasting.
